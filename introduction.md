As you may, already know, my name is Ajay Jayswal and I have been in the IT industry for 11 years.

Throughout my 11 years of experience, I have worked on engineering positions on Linux, Build and Release, Devops and AWS.

Currently on my project, I am part of the command centre and we are working with the operations group.

On my team, we currently have 12 people that are part of the Devops and Cloud  Team. Now in my team we are working on 3 products  all of which are on 1.8 Java Enterprise Edition based architecture. Spring boot is what we are using for our microservices.We are using Eureka for the service discovery.

Most of the apps I support are in AWS using RHEL 7 and RHEL 8 (Red Hat enterprise Linux)

 As you probably have taken a look at my resume, I have a really great Linux Backbone. So having that networking and LVM, as well as the production support with performance tuning would be a plus for what you might be needing for someone having that linux background.

So coming towards monitoring, we are using Splunk for the analytics for the API integration. I have some experience with AppDynamics, nagios and new relic as well.

As for AWS, Azure and GCP, currently we are involved in designing, and deploying most of the web based applications.

I also helped my current client Weather Channel to migrate from their on-prem environment to the AWS, Azure and GCP Cloud.

I also have experience with creating scripted or declarative  CI-CD pipeline⁠⁠⁠⁠ in Jenkins⁠⁠⁠⁠. I also have exposure to integrate the GIT with Jenkins along with SonarQube and Cobertura. We are storing our artifacts at the J-Frog artifactory

My core areas of expertise,  i would say would be that  I am an expert in using Jenkins for continuous integration, hands on the Chef for the configuration management and have good exposure on Kubernetes for the container orchestration.

In the past, I have used Docker Swarm and Mesos environment as well as a CLustering and Orchestration tool for the microservices.
